## Description
This is a scheduler you can use to help schedule out your busy day. Fill in the time blocks with task or events you need to tackle throughout your day. Type your events in a time block and save it by pressing on the save button to the right. The color of the block will help display if the events time is in the past, present, or future. There's a date along with a clock at the top of the page counting away, emphasising how important every second of the day is!
